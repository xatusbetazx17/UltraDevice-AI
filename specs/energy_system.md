# Energy System

- **Baseline Source**: Conceptual, safe, continuous output on the order of 100–500 mW.
- **Battery**: Lightweight pack (e.g., 10–20 Wh).
- **Harvesting**: Solar (0–1 W daylight), kinetic (0–0.5 W active), thermal (0–0.2 W).
- **Policy**: Prioritize harvest use, preserve battery for bursts.
- **Cooldown**: Enforced between boosts to respect thermal comfort.
