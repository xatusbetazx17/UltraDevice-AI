# Storage & CPU

- **Storage**: 1–5 TB class solid-state envisioned; encrypted; partitioned for models/logs.
- **RAM**: 8–32 GB class low-power LPDDR as a future baseline.
- **CPU/GPU/NPU**: Heterogeneous; AI acceleration for on-device inference.
- **Policy**: DVFS and task shedding when below power thresholds.
