# Wearable Materials

- **Outer Layer**: Abrasion-resistant weave.
- **Mid Layer**: Elastic matrix with microencapsulated self-repair resin (fictional concept).
- **Inner Layer**: Breathable wick for comfort.
- **Seams**: Reinforced for load distribution.
- # Wearable Materials
- Durability/self-repair are conceptual; simulator maps to added power cost under stress.
