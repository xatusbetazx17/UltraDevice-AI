# Overview

UltraDevice AI is a speculative wearable that balances **capability** with **constraints**.
Key threads:
- **Energy-first design** (everything is limited by power & heat)
- **Safety & ethics** (fictional features remain non-operational in real life)
- **Modular specs** (each capability increases power draw and weight)
